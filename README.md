# Whos that pokemon!
A Pokemon game where you get shown a pokemon silhouette and four answers, you can keep trying to click the guesses until you find the right pokemon.

It is currently only generation 1 pokemons, and it goes on for infinity, some cool future additions would be:
- Possibility to choose which generation you want to test.
- Keep score of how many pokemon you have gotten correctly within that generation.
- Keep a highscore?
- Leaderboards?
